2015-01-26 version 0.6.7:

* Fixed "tuple concurrently updated" error happened when multiple threads
  connect to the pg_database concurrently.
* Rewrite "... AS FLOAT)" to "... AS double)" for better compatibility with
  Tableau because Presto doesn't support FLOAT type


2015-01-05 version 0.6.6:

* setup_system_catalog renames PostgreSQL's system column names to avoid
  "column name ... conflicts with a system column name" error. When a table or
  query result includes reserved system column names, we need to add "_" at
  the end of column names to access them (e.g. oid_, ctid_).
  Reserved system column names are documented at
  http://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.3/static/ddl-system-columns.html


2015-01-04 version 0.6.5:

* setup_system_catalog renames duplicated column names in case a table has
  duplicated column names
* Removed unnecessary CREATE ROLE call from prestogres_init_database function
* Removed DROP FUNCTION call which was added for backward compatibility
* Added test framework and some tests


2014-12-16 version 0.6.4:

* Changed default pid file path to /tmp
* prestores-ctl searches postgres command from /usr/lib/postgresql/*/bin/ as
  well as initdb to for Ubuntu environment
* Fixed error handling when init_system_db_connection fails
* s/pool_hba.conf/prestogres_hba.conf/ at the sample prestogres.conf file


2014-12-04 version 0.6.3:

* prestogres-ctl works with Python 2.6 on CentOS
* Fixed a syntax error at setup.sql


2014-12-04 version 0.6.2:

This release updates PL/Python function signature. You need to run
"$ prestogres-ctl migrate" command.

* setup_system_catalog overwrites search_path to presto_schema to solve
  inconsistency where search_path on PostgreSQL doesn't match with schema name
  (X-Presto-Schema) on Presto.


2014-12-04 version 0.6.1:

* setup_system_catalog grants USAGE privilege so that pg_table_is_visible
  function used by \d of psql command works
* setup_system_catalog grants SELECT privilege so that
  has_table_privilege(relname, 'select') returns true
* Added a query rewriting rule from 'AS INTEGER)' to 'AS bigint)' to be
  compatible with Tableau 8.2
* Added a type conversion rule from Presto's array to PostgreSQL's json [#20]


2014-12-03 version 0.6.0:

* Login database name is used for presto_catalog and presto_schema by default.
  default. You can use multiple catalogs using one Prestogres instance.
* Added support for cursors. DECLARE starts a query on Presto, FETCH fetches
  results, and CLOSE deletes the query from Presto.
* Added support for multi-statement queries as long as there is only one Presto
  query
* Added support for INSERT INTO ... VALUES and INSERT INTO ... SELECT added
  since Presto 0.75
* Added support for CREATE TABLE and CREATE TABLE ... AS SELECT added
  since Presto 0.73.
* Added support for EXPLAIN.
* BEGIN command in multi-statement query actually runs on PostgreSQL and returns
  "BEGIN" notice message to clients to be compatible with postgresql-jdbc with
  setAutoCommit(false) mode.


2014-12-02 version 0.5.5:

* Fixed 'duplicate key value violates unique constraint "pg_database_datname_index"'
exception at setup_system_catalog. New code modifies pg_catalog.pg_proc where
procname='current_database' rather than updating pg_database to fake behavior
of current_database() function.


2014-12-01 version 0.5.4:

* "prestogres-ctl create" searches initdb comand from /usr/lib/postgresql/*/bin/initdb
because Debian and Ubuntu don't have initdb in PATH environment variable


2014-12-01 version 0.5.3:

* Added support for querying ROW and MAP types using "json" type of PostgreSQL


2014-12-01 version 0.5.2:

* Canceling query works thanks for an upstream fix of pgpool2
* Fixed support for ROW type


2014-11-30 version 0.5.1:

* Added missing prestogres/Makefile.in


2014-11-30 version 0.5.0:

This major release is not backward compatible. You need to recreate PostgreSQL
database. See README.md file for instruction.

* Creating tables runs only once for each session when a client runs a query
for the first time
* System catalog queries directly run on PostgreSQL without rewriting
* System catalog queries can include duplicated column names

results are returned to PostgreSQL using iterator

  gurantee order

  name
* System catalog queries update pg_database to be consistent with login
  databae name
* Added support for information_schema
* Added special type conversion rules to support information_schema

  (NAMEDATALEN - 1) characters which cause an error in PostgreSQL


2014-05-12 version 0.4.4:

* Send session variable 'timezone' to Presto using X-Presto-Time-Zone HTTP
  header introduced by Presto 0.66 so that Presto uses the same time zone
  setting with PostgreSQL.


2014-04-22 version 0.4.3:

* Updated default parameters related to connections so that pgpool-II can
  always acquire a connection to cancel a running query.


2014-03-19 version 0.4.2:

* Send queries to PostgreSQL if they most likely cause parse erorr because
  Presto doesn't return appropriate error code (42601 SYNTAX ERROR).
* Cast Presto query results to PostgreSQL types explicitly when it inserts
  themn to a temporary table to not cause "value too long for type character
  varying(255)" exceptions
